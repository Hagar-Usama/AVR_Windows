## Introduction

XPians, that code is for you 🎉 💙

---

## Technologies

* interactive batch file to compile and upload AVR codes 🙌
* supports windows xp sp2 [32-bit]
---

## Launch

 How to Launch?
 > Double click on the batch file **compile_upload_avr**, and follow the instructions in. Easy ha? 😀

<!-- include screenshots -->

👉 **Note you will need to install avr-gcc package and USBASP driver**


Why would I use such a script?
> If you - for some reason - use Windows XP sp2 or older versions, you have few options to compile and upload/burn your code (if you are just familiar with user-friendly IDEs). This script is one option 😎.

Do people still use Windows XP?
> Surprisingly, yes and more than you think.
